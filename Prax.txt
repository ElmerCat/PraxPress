Hello - This is a Swift 6 / macOS 26 only app.
Please search for the Prax code to see all 9 .swift source files in the project:  "Prax=0104-0"

The page trim rectangles are now working correctly.  Can you add a feature where one of the PDF pages can be set as a "Width Guide Page". Then, have the left and right trimmed edges of that page appear as guidelines on top of the other pages, and allow their trim rectangles to snap and match those boundaries?
