Hello - This is a Swift 6 / macOS 26 only app.
Please search for the Prax code to see all 8 .swift source files in the project:  "Prax=1229-3"

The PageTrimView uses a private PDFPageListView to display thumbnails of the PDF pages.  How can this be replaced with a proper PDFKit PDFThumbnailView which can take advantage of built-in dragging to rearrange PDF pages?
