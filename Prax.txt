Hello - This is a Swift 6 / macOS 26 only app.
Please search for the Prax code to see all 10 .swift source files in the project:  "Prax=0102-0"

The PDFPageOverlayViewProvider is now working correctly. Trim rectangles can be set and adjusted for each individual page, however the values don't seem to be set correctly in PDFModel and the resulting merged preview is not correct.  Can you figure out what's wrong?
